# Introduction
This project demonstrates an augmented reality (AR) experience built with A-Frame, Three.js, and JavaScript. It allows users to place a 3D model in their environment and view it with realistic shadows.

## How to use it
* Open in your mobile browser
* Point your device's camera to the floor
* Experience augmented reality as the 3D model appears on the marker
* you can change the position of the model by placing it anywhere on floor

# Features
* Placement and Shadow Casting: Users can place the 3D model in their AR environment and observe dynamic shadows cast by a directional light.
* Responsive Design: The experience adapts to different devices and screen sizes.
* Customizable AR scenes and interactions.

# Technologies Used:
* A-Frame: A web framework for building VR and AR experiences.
* Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D graphics.
* JavaScript: The primary programming language used for development.


# Customization:
* You can replace the big_ben.glb file with your own 3D model (ensure it's in a compatible format like GLB).
* Adjust the properties of the A-Frame elements and JavaScript components to customize the appearance and behavior of the AR experience.
